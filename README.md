### Details:
#### This script is written to work in a Ubuntu System. It uses the linux iptables firewall and openvpn.
#### It is tested to work on PSN, Xbox and Steam.
#### The first two accounts added must be the hosts of each fireteam.
#### If the firewall is active, accounts that are not already in the firewall will be unable to join the fireteam. You can run the auto sniffer to add them.
#### Please do not run this on your personal computer it will clobber your firewall rules. It is meant to be run in an isolated enviroment (vm, vps, spare pc).
#### Credits to inchenzo & BasRaayman for coming up with the method.
